# About this project

### Project Name: Whim

### Business Purpose:

The aim of this app is to bring like-minded people together and help people share or get help on their hobbies. We will enable two types of users: users who is willing to help and user who is looking for help with their hobbies.
Ex: I wish to learn guitar, I can look for people willing to teach me on the website.

1. Who is our targeted customer?
   The best way to do business is focus on large number of sales with minimum margin of profit per product. This will help a business grow fast, be competitive in the market and reach a wider range of customers.
   We will be achieving the above goal in two ways:
   (i) One best way to achieve this is to get users into monthly subscription instead of users having to buy individual contents. The monthly cost will be as low as a large pizza which everyone can afford at this point of time. It is like being able to afford one pizza in entire month.
   (ii) Second way is to monetize our e-learning materials by introducing controlled and limited adds into our documented materials and videos. User gets a 70% off on the monthly cost if they choose to go with the adds. It will help both, us as a business and our users. This option will start from as low as $5/month subscription price which will make it one of the most affordable e-learning platforms in market.
   The best part of Whim is it will have a vast variety of content to target every age group. E-learning courses are always affordable than a physical book and is sustainable as it does not need paper or ink. This is another way of cost cutting and making courses available for low price.
   On top, we will be offering deals on high demand courses to make it easy for everyone to afford without burning a hole in their pockets. Plus, we will offer stack discount on the monthly price if someone completes more than three course in a month. This business idea will be unique and will attract more customers.
   Lastly, most of our users are expected to be working professionals who are looking to upskill or students who are looking to learn new things. Those sections of the society should be able to afford the pricing we are looking to offer.

2. Will the targeted customer be able to afford our product?
   As an online platform, our users will have the ability to use our app even from their cellphone. Every age group these days have access to a smartphone, which makes it easy for our customers to access available materials on the go.
   With popular platforms like YouTube and Instagram we can easily reach a larger audience to market our awesome product. Social media adds are the best way to reach the biggest possible crowd as almost everyone uses them these days.
   On top, we will reach out to the schools and offices to market our product, as those people would be our prime users. Our content will be highly tailored and filtered for best user experience. The videos with high search and views will be promoted to attract more customers.
   Our main sales and marketing strategy is to offer best possible education for most affordable price, to attract biggest possible crowd with lowest profit per product instead of the opposite. For the price of one pizza or possibly a cup of coffee we offer the best education they are looking for, and that too for the entire month.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
